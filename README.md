## Journal Reflection  

**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**  
The app I developed was a weight tracking application designed to let users log, update, and monitor their weight progress over time. The main goal was to create a simple and functional tool that supported personal health and fitness goals while making the process easy to use on mobile devices.  

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**  
The app included a login screen, a dashboard showing weight entries, forms to add or update entries, and navigation to move between sections. My UI kept users in mind by keeping the layout simple, the text readable, and the navigation intuitive. These design choices made the app quick to learn and easy to use, which is why I’d call the design successful.  

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**  
I approached the coding process by breaking the project into smaller tasks, starting with setting up activities and layouts, then wiring in the CRUD functionality for weight entries, and finally polishing with validation and navigation. Strategies like modular coding and using clear naming conventions made it easier to debug and will be useful for future projects.  

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**  
I tested my app by running it on an emulator and checking each feature step by step, like adding, updating, and deleting entries. This process was important because it showed me that the core functions worked and also revealed small bugs in navigation that I was able to fix before finalizing.  

**Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**  
One area I had to innovate was handling input validation and error states in a way that didn’t frustrate users. I had to balance giving clear error messages without cluttering the UI, and I solved it by keeping messages short and only showing them when needed.  

**In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**  
I was particularly successful in implementing the CRUD operations for the weight entries. That part showed I could connect the UI to the logic, manage the data flow, and keep everything functional. It demonstrated my ability to go from design to working code in a way that users could interact with smoothly.
